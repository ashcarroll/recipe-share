# recipe-share

## Project concept:

RecipeShare is designed to allow users to browse a collection of recipes, either organised by cuisine or the whole catalog altogether.

Only users registered as chefs contribute their recipes, ensuring a variety of high-quality dishes for everyone to view. Each recipe is detailed with an ingredients list, step by step instructions and expected time to complete. 

Users can save their favorite recipes to their unique favorites page to go back to anytime they want. 


## Features

- <em>Home page</em> - Recipes categorised by cuisine
- <em>Recipes page</em> - Full list of recipes not defined by cuisine
- <em>'Surprise me' button</em> - A button that gives a user a random recipe from the site (incase they can't decide what to have for dinner, the answer is given to them)
- <em>Favorites</em> - Store a unique list of your favorite recipes for you to cook time again
- <em>Unique User registration</em> - Define users on if they are a chef or a general user, permissions and access to certain features are dependent on user type
- <em>Add Recipe</em> - Easy to use form for users registered as Chefs, to add their recipes to the website
